Data Shield
An automated Python-based backup system that performs incremental backups, detects file changes using MD5 hashing, and automatically creates ZIP archives for secure storage.

Overview
Data Shield is designed to automate the process of backing up important files and folders. Instead of copying all files every time, the system intelligently identifies only new or modified files and backs them up, making the process faster and more storage-efficient.

The application also generates compressed ZIP archives of the backup folder and supports scheduled execution at user-defined intervals.

Features
-> Automated backup scheduling
-> Incremental backup mechanism
-> MD5 hash-based file comparison
-> Copies only new or modified files
-> Preserves original file metadata
-> Automatic ZIP archive creation
-> Command-line interface support
-> Lightweight and easy to use
